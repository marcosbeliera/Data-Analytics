## Welcome to my Data Visualization GitHub Repository!

I am excited to share with you my last projects in Data Visualization, which showcases my skills and expertise in a range of powerful tools:

- Power BI
- SQL
- Plotly and Docker 

Throughout theses projects, I have leveraged my knowledge to create impactful data visualizations that tell compelling stories. By exploring the relationships and trends in the data, I have been able to uncover key insights and make data-driven decisions.

Whether you are an employer or a colleague, I invite you to explore theses projects and get a glimpse of my skillset in action.

*Thank you for taking the time to learn more about some of my different projects. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any project further, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.*
