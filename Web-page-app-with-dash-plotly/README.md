## Multi-page web app created with Dash-Plotly

This multi-page app and its analysis were developed to study the diversity of different hair brands in the United States.

## Context of the analysis

To conduct the analysis, there were collected 2718 TikTok public videos published by US HairCare companies in the years 2021 and 2022. I have used a tagging system to scan the videos and generate associated tags with an 85% confidence interval.

The tags associated with models featured in the advertisement were then categorized in terms of ethnic backgrounds and age groups. The purpose of this categorization was to compare the resulting groups against several sources, including the most recent US population census data from 2020 , a study of the US Population by Race, and information on TikTok users by age range in 2023. This comparison was intended to observe which advertising campaigns vary from the country's population and the current users of TikTok.

Finally, I have calculated a percentage of diversity (%) by using the concept of "Entropy" to quantify the level of diversity in a given dataset for each brand. Entropy is calculated by the overall frequency distribution of ethnicity tags for each company during a certain period. For example, if a dataset contains equal numbers of two different classes (f.i. latinos and black group), the entropy would be high. On the other hand, if a dataset contains only one class (only latinos), the entropy would be low because we donâ€™t have the distribution homogeneity.
